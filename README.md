**congressional_legislative_election_results**

These are cleaned CSV files of Clinton and Trump vote share by congressional and legislative district using data compiled by the [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/6/1629653/-Daily-Kos-Elections-2016-presidential-results-for-congressional-and-legislative-districts "Daily Kos Election Data"). 
I link every district to unique identifiers used by the Census to make it easier to merge to other datasets (e.g., ACS files).

Please file an issue if you notice anything wrong!

**Warnings:** This does not include every legislative district. 
In some cases, Daily Kos only has data on a subset of states and in other cases, there was no straightforward merge to the Census files.
This is a starting point and anyone using this data should be sure to spot-check their own cases. I also have not verified the accuracy
of Daily Kos's data.

**Updates** as of 6 August 2018 â€” Additional state legislative districts added, still missing AL, AR, MS and the Nebraska unicam
